# Finish X86 for PE and ELF on Unicorn -> OK
  - Custom Stubs Ok 
  - Tag Stubs Ok 
  - PE Stubs Ok 
  - Elf Stub Ok 

# Harmonized sub system -> OK 
  - Done, but NEED TESTING (see testing harness)

# Add AARCH64 Support -> OK
  - Use SSTIC 2019 binary

# Add X64 Support -> OK 
  Done 

# Make a Doc (how to use it)
  TODO

# Make a testing harness 
  - For each architecture with several examples :
     - x86 PE & ELF (test stub mechanisms [tag,null,standart])
     - x64 PE & ELF (test stub mechanisms [idem])
     - ARM (find other binary than isoinit) + ARM Thumb (QB chall) (test stubs)
     - MIPS32L MIPS32B (test stubs)
    
# Rethink color system 
  - Current implem in buggy 
  - Store insn color in conf, and automatically restore from it ? 


# Add idc shortcut binding for debugging 
  - Step in 

#Â Add parsing PT_DYNAMIC segment functionnality 
   - Purpose is to autostub all imports (with null stub)

# Ease the use of the app. 
   ideas:
      - get func prototype and generate a default conf
      arguments, start/end exec addr  
      - add right-click submenu to create mem map
