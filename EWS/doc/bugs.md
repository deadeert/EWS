Need to load plugin CTRL+ALT+E to get the ews popup menu in disas view. 
This should be done automatically when the plugin loads.

# Bug1

PC value is not synchronized with print features (log or views)

# Bug2 

Removing stub does not work because tool does not track the replaced
instructions. Not planned to be supported in next versions. Please
reload the emulator. 
Warning configuration object keep track of the stubbed function.
