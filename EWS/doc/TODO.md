# TODOs

## UI

-Add a console windows to query the emulator. 
-Better UI, anyone ? 

## Standalone Script 

-Make a standalone version of the plugin (running outside IDA),
configuration could be exported from the plugin then imported in 
the script. Evaluate how precious it'll be versus how many time it will take.
